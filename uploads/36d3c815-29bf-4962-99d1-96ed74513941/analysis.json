Recommendations for LVMH  \n\n**Actionable Insights Based on Competitive Landscape**:  \n\n1. **Adopt Tiered Incentives**:  \n   - **Evidence**: Nars uses tiered payouts ($10–$80) for incremental sales targets.  \n   - **Recommendation**: Implement tiered rewards for LVMH brands (e.g., Dior, Givenchy) to motivate higher sales volumes.  \n\n2. **Bundle Products for Higher Incentives**:  \n   - **Evidence**: Fragrance Multibrand and CK/Chloe/Kylie reward sales of bundled sets.  \n   - **Recommendation**: Promote LVMH fragrance or makeup sets (e.g., travel-sized pairings) with per-bundle incentives.  \n\n3. **Leverage Testers as Low-Cost Incentives**:  \n   - **Evidence**: Hermes offers testers for bulk sales, reducing cash/voucher payouts.  \n   - **Recommendation**: Use testers of premium products (e.g., Louis Vuitton fragrances) as staff rewards to maintain budget efficiency.  \n\n4. **Target Suncare and Skincare Segments**:  \n   - **Evidence**: Lancaster focuses on suncare with volume-based incentives.  \n   - **Recommendation**: Incentivize sales of LVMH-owned skincare lines (e.g., Fresh, Benefit) during peak suncare demand periods.  \n\n5. **Clarify Incentive Structures**:  \n   - **Evidence**: Hermes and Diptyque have complex rules (e.g., caps, tester eligibility).  \n   - **Recommendation**: Simplify LVMH incentive terms (e.g., flat rates per product sold) to avoid confusion and ensure staff engagement.  \n\n6. **Capitalize on Seasonal Sets**:  \n   - **Evidence**: Hermes and Holiday SKUs highlight seasonal collections (e.g., X’mas, CNY).  \n   - **Recommendation**: Align LVMH promotions with seasonal launches (e.g., Valentine’s Day sets) and attach higher incentives to these items.  \n\n**Rationale**:  \nThe analysis reveals a focus on volume-based rewards, tiered structures, and non-monetary perks (testers). LVMH can differentiate by combining simplified incentives with premium product bundles and seasonal alignment to capture staff motivation and customer interest."}
