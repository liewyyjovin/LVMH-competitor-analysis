Likely a data entry error, but if valid, it would dominate staff focus.  \n2. **Cartier’s $5 Cash Per Bottle:**  \n   - Simple, immediate cash rewards with no caps or thresholds. Easy to understand and appealing for high-volume sellers.  \n3. **Diptyque’s $5 Per Item for Volume Sales:**  \n   - Rewards bulk sales with direct payroll credits, incentivizing staff to push multiple units.  \n\n#### 2. **Top 3 Strategies to Compete**  \n1. **Tiered Cash Incentives for High-Value SKUs:**  \n   - Offer escalating cash rewards for selling LVMH’s high-margin products (e.g., $10 cash for 1 bottle, $25 for 3). This outperforms Cartier’s flat $5 rate.  \n2. **Combined Volume + Product Rewards:**  \n   - Pair cash incentives with exclusive product testers (e.g., “Sell 5 Dior Sauvage EDT 100ml, get $50 + a limited-edition tester”). Combats Hermes’ tester-driven strategy.  \n3. **Simplified Voucher Thresholds:**  \n   - Replace complex tiered systems (e.g., NARS) with straightforward rewards (e.g., “$20 voucher per $1,000 sold”). Reduces confusion and increases transparency.  \n\n#### 3. **Ensuring Staff Adoption**  \n1. **Clarity Over Complexity:**  \n   - Train staff with clear, one-sentence explanations (e.g., “Sell 3 bottles, earn $30 cash today”). Avoid multi-tiered or capped incentives that require mental calculation.  \n2. **Immediate Payouts:**  \n   - Highlight instant rewards (e.g., daily cash bonuses) versus competitors’ delayed vouchers or payroll credits.  \n3. **Competitive Benchmarking:**  \n   - Share side-by-side comparisons (e.g., “Cartier pays $5 per bottle; we pay $8”). Use visual aids in staff areas to reinforce advantages."}
