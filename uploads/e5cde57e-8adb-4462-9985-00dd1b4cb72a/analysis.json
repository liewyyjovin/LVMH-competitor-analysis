Locations follow major duty-free terminal layouts  \n2. SKUs inferred from brand hero products  \n3. Cash incentives tied to luxury's standard 5-15% commission ranges  \n4. Vouchers structured to drive cross-selling\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations & Analysis\n\n**1. Top 3 Most Attractive Incentives**  \na) Cartier's 10% cash bonus (high-value, immediate payout)  \nb) Hermes' €300 internal credit (exclusivity appeal)  \nc) Drunk Elephant's 8% commission boost (stackable earnings)\n\n**2. Competing Strategies**  \na) **Tiered Cash Bonuses**: Offer 12% commission on key LVMH products (e.g., Dior Sauvage) for sales above €7k/week  \nb) **Experiential Vouchers**: Replace generic vouchers with \"VIP Fragrance Masterclass\" access for every 3 perfume sales  \nc) **Collectible Product Incentives**: Create limited-edition Louis Vuitton travel kits only available to top 10% performers monthly\n\n**3. Staff Communication Plan**  \n- **Comparison Charts**: Visually show how LVMH incentives exceed competitors (e.g., \"12% vs 10% cash bonus\")  \n- **Success Stories**: Share testimonials like \"BA Marie earned €500 extra with our tiered system vs old flat rate\"  \n- **Instant Gratification**: Structure rewards to payout weekly instead of monthly like competitors  \n\n*Rationale*: Luxury staff prioritize 1) earning potential, 2) brand prestige, and 3) gamification. LVMH can dominate by combining higher cash payouts with exclusive experiences that leverage its brand equity."}
